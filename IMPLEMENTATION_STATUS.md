## 📋 Pending Implementation (Future Enhancements)

### GraphQL Layer (Non-Critical)
- ✅ GraphQL schema definition (complete)
- ⏳ GraphQL resolvers implementation (schema complete but resolvers pending)

- ⏳ GraphQL query complexity analysis and rate limiting
- ⏳ GraphQL playground setup for development

### Advanced Features (Non-Critical)
- ✅ Bulk download functionality (file aggregation and zip downloads)
- ✅ Advanced caching strategies (Redis with TTL optimization)
- ✅ Performance optimizations (DataLoader, query batching)
- ✅ Full-text search for apartments (opensearch integration)
- ✅ Images and videos must be uploaded from the frontend to minio directly, but the api must manage the signed url

### Security Enhancements (Non-Critical)
- ✅ Rate limiting per user/endpoint
- ⏳ API key management system
- ⏳ Audit logging for admin actions
- ⏳ CORS configuration refinement
- ⏳ Security headers middleware

### Monitoring & Observability (Non-Critical)

- ⏳ Distributed tracing (Jaeger/OpenTelemetry)
- ⏳ Health check improvements (dependency checks)
- ⏳ Performance monitoring and alerting
- ⏳ Error tracking (Sentry integration)
- ⏳ Application performance monitoring (APM)

### API Documentation (Non-Critical)
- ✅ OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- ⏳ API versioning strategy
- ✅ Interactive API documentation setup

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The current implementation provides:

1. **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based auth with RBAC
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Clean architecture with interfaces
3. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with proper migrations

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

## 📊 Test Results
