# Terra Allwert API - Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Architecture
- ✅ Clean Architecture with domain/data/infra layers
- ✅ Interface-driven design following SOLID principles
- ✅ Dependency injection with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Error handling and graceful shutdown

### Domain Layer
- ✅ Complete domain entities (User, Tower, Floor, Apartment, Gallery, ImagePin)
- ✅ Repository interfaces for all entities
- ✅ Business logic abstractions (AuthService, StorageService)
- ✅ RBAC system with roles (admin, viewer)

### Data Layer
- ✅ Repository implementations with GORM
- ✅ Database migrations with PostgreSQL
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- ✅ Search capabilities for apartments

### Infrastructure
- ✅ JWT authentication service
- ✅ MinIO storage integration with signed URLs
- ✅ Redis caching setup
- ✅ Docker infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO)
- ✅ Configuration management with environment variables

### API Layer
- ✅ GraphQL schema definition (complete)
- ✅ Authentication endpoints (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/refresh)
- ✅ Protected routes with JWT middleware
- ✅ RBAC middleware for role-based access

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for authentication service
- ✅ Integration tests for API handlers
- ✅ Mock implementations for testing
- ✅ Test fixtures and utilities
- ✅ E2E test structure

### DevOps
- ✅ Docker compose for development
- ✅ Go workspace configuration (src/test separation)
- ✅ Proper dependency management
- ✅ Organized project structure with single handlers directory

## 📋 Pending Implementation (Future Enhancements)

### GraphQL Layer (Non-Critical)
- ⏳ GraphQL resolvers implementation (schema complete but resolvers pending)
- ⏳ DataLoader for N+1 query optimization
- ⏳ Real-time subscriptions
- ⏳ GraphQL query complexity analysis

### Advanced Features (Non-Critical)
- ⏳ Bulk download functionality (file aggregation and zip downloads)
- ⏳ Performance optimizations (advanced caching strategies, DataLoader)
- ⏳ File upload validation and image processing
- ⏳ Image resizing/optimization
- ⏳ Full-text search for apartments

### Monitoring & Observability
- ⏳ Structured logging with correlation IDs
- ⏳ Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- ⏳ Health check improvements
- ⏳ Performance monitoring

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The current implementation provides:

1. **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based auth with RBAC
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Clean architecture with interfaces
3. **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with proper migrations
4. **File Storage**: MinIO integration with direct uploads
5. **Testing Coverage**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
6. **Docker Support**: Full containerized development environment

## 🔧 Running the Application

```bash
# Start infrastructure
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.infra.yml up -d

# Run the application
go run main.go

# Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}'
```

## 📊 Test Results

- ✅ Authentication service tests: PASS
- ✅ API handler tests: PASS
- ✅ Application build: SUCCESS
- ✅ Infrastructure startup: SUCCESS
- ✅ Login functionality: WORKING
- ✅ RBAC authorization: WORKING

## 💡 Next Steps

1. Implement GraphQL resolvers using gqlgen
2. Add DataLoader for performance optimization
3. Implement bulk download service
4. Add comprehensive logging
5. Setup CI/CD pipeline
6. Performance testing and optimization
